# Symmetric Tree

## [101. Symmetric Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/symmetric-tree)

**Problem statement:**
Given the `root` of a binary tree, check whether it is a mirror of itself (i.e., symmetric around its center).
 
**Example 1:**

```
Input: root = [1,2,2,3,4,4,3]
Output: true
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: root = [1,2,2,null,3,null,3]
Output: false
```

**Constraints:**

* `The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 1000].`
* `-100 <= Node.val <= 100`

**Follow-up**: Could you solve it both recursively and iteratively?
