# Minimum Depth of Binary Tree

## [111. Minimum Depth of Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-depth-of-binary-tree/)

**Problem statement:**

Given a binary tree, find its minimum depth.

The minimum depth is the number of nodes along the shortest path from the root node down to the nearest leaf node.

**Note**: A leaf is a node with no children.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
Output: 2
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: root = [2,null,3,null,4,null,5,null,6]
Output: 5
```

**Constraints:**

* *The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 10<sup>5</sup>]*.
* *-1000 <= Node.val <= 1000*
