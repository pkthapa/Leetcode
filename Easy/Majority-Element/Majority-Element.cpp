    // Approach 1: Boyerâ€“Moore majority vote algorithm.
    //
    // Intuition Behind Working:
    // When the elements are the same as the candidate element, votes are incremented.
    // When some other element is found not equal to the candidate element, we decrease the count.
    // This actually means that we are decreasing the priority of winning ability of the selected candidate, since we know that
    // if the candidate is a majority it occurs more than N/2 times and the remaining elements are less than N/2.
    // We keep decreasing the votes since we found some different element than the candidate element.
    // When votes become 0, this actually means that there are the same number of different elements, which should not be the case for the element
    // to be the majority element. So the candidate element cannot be the majority, so we choose the present element as the candidate
    // and continue the same till all the elements get finished. The final candidate would be our majority element.
    // We check using the 2nd traversal to see whether its count is greater than N/2.
    // If it is true, we consider it as the majority element.
    int majorityElement(vector<int>& nums) {
        int me = nums[0];
        int votes = 1; // Starting with '1' because 'me' is initialized with nums[0].

        for (int i = 1; i < nums.size(); ++i) { // Start from next
            if (nums[i] == me) {
                ++votes;
            }
            else if (0 == votes) {
                me = nums[i];
