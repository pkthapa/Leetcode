# Balanced Binary Tree

## [110. Balanced Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/balanced-binary-tree/)

**Problem statement:**

Given a binary tree, determine if it is height-balanced.

For this problem, a height-balanced binary tree is defined as:

*a binary tree in which the left and right subtrees of every node differ in height by no more than 1*.
