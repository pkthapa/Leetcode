# Happy Number

## [202. Happy Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/happy-number)

**Problem statement:**
Write an algorithm to determine if a number `n` is happy.

A **happy number** is a number defined by the following process:

* Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits.
* Repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1.
* Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy.

Return `true` if `n` is a happy number, and `false` if not.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: n = 19
Output: true

Explanation:
1^2 + 9^2 = 82
8^2 + 2^2 = 68
6^2 + 8^2 = 100
1^2 + 0^2 + 0^2 = 1
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: n = 2
Output: false

Explanation:
2^2 = 4
4^2 = 16
1^2 + 6^2 = 37
3^2 + 7^2 = 58
5^2 + 8^2 = 89
8^2 + 9^2 = 145
1^2 + 4^2 + 5^2 = 42
4^2 + 2^2 = 20
2^2 + 0^2 = 4 (This has occurred in the beginning)
```

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= n <= 2^31 - 1`
